      <p>Microbial communities are critical for human health and agriculture, and control all
biogeochemical cycles on earth. Understanding these communities is critical for
both basic science and applications. <strong>I develop novel experimental, computational, and theoretical
approaches to study microbial communities in the lab and in nature</strong></p>
<p>Cooperation in biology is widespread and fundamental. For example, cooperation is at the heart of the
evolution of multicellularity, one of the major transitions in evolution. Therefore, understanding the evolution
and ecology of cooperative behaviors is central to our understanding of nature. Cooperation is also
widespread in simple organisms like bacteria, which mostly cooperate by producing public-goods -
molecules that benefit the entire community but are costly to produce. This form of cooperation is especially
susceptible to parasitism, or cheating, by individuals that benefit from the public-good but do not produce it
themselves. My scientific journey so far has been focused on exploring the consequences of this conflict
between cooperation and cheating on bacterial evolution and ecology.</p>
<p>My recent work on marine bacterial communities that degrade chitin saw this interest take many forms,
where I collaborated heavily across different projects. Chitin is the most abundant polysaccharide in marine environments, and the second most abundant polysaccharide on earth after cellulose. Chitin recycling by
bacterial communities accounts for a significant portion of marine net primary production and is a central
process in the marine carbon cycle. Bacteria must degrade chitin extracellularly before utilizing it for growth
by secreting specialized enzymes called chitinases. Because the released degradation products are free to
diffuse in the environment, bacteria that are able to consume these molecules but do not degrade the
polymer can be regarded as cheaters.</p>
<img align="right" src="trophic.svg">
In my main postdoc project (Pollak et. al. 2021) we asked a seemingly simple question – what is the effect
of cheating interactions on community dynamics and chitin turnover? Because most data on bacterial
communities in the environment is DNA sequence data, we wanted to develop computational methods that
could answer this question using genomic information. This is non-trivial because of the gap in our
knowledge about the molecular function of many genes found in environmental DNA samples, and because
we don’t know which cellular processes characterize cheaters. We solved both issues by identifying
thousands of genes that are co-gained/lost together with chitinases from bacterial genomes. Co-evolution is
a strong predictor of shared function and our assumption was that the identified genes contribute to chitin
utilization. The identified genes encoded for diverse functions besides metabolism such as motility and
environmental sensing, but were mostly of unknown function. We developed a machine-learning algorithm
to identify exploiters based on the co-evolving genes, and found that cheating evolved multiple times
throughout evolution, and that exploiters are as common as degraders during early stages of chitin
degradation, potentially impacting carbon turnover on a global scale.
<p>This work fundamentally changed our view of community dynamics and function. Collaborating with the lab
of Prof. Uwe Saur at ETH, we showed using metabolomics that chitin degraders produce characteristic
degradation and metabolic waste products, thereby controlling the downstream assembly of the community
(Pontrelli et. al. 2022). Finally, we utilized the tools I developed to characterize the processes contributing
the variability in community development on individual chitin particles, finding that predation by
bacteriophages is a major factor contributing to variability (Szabo et. al. PNAS 2022).</p>
